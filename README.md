# Predictive Modeling of Mice Behavior through Neural Activity: Integrating PCA, Random Forest, and Multi-layer Perceptron Approaches

## Summary
In this project, I began by generating synthetic data that follows a multimodal Gaussian distribution with specified parameters. I then constructed various machine learning models to approximate this multimodal Gaussian distribution, subsequently comparing their accuracies and execution times.


## Setup
This project is developed using Python 3. Refer to `main.ipynb` for the required packages.


## File Descriptions
- `main.ipynb`: Python notebook responsible for data generation and model construction.
- `fit_gaussian.html`: HTML export of the `main.ipynb` notebook.
- `presentation.mp4`: A brief video presentation discussing the work and key concepts of the project.


## Content
This project includes 7 parts in total, specifically: 
1. Synthesize a multimodal Gaussian distribution
2. Fit a piecewise linear regression model
3. Fit three spline models with 2, 3, and 4 knots respectively
4. Compare the R-squared values and root mean square deviations (RMSD) of the models from the previous sections
5. Fit four polynomial models with degree 2,3,4,5 respectively
6. Compare the fitting times of the constructed models
7. Construct two polynomial models of degree 5 using Lasso and Ridge regularization techniques
