# Predictive Modeling of Mice Behavior through Neural Activity: Integrating PCA, Random Forest, and Multi-layer Perceptron Approaches

## Summary
In partnership with Cruz-Martin from the Center for Systems Neuroscience at Boston University, this project focuses on 
predicting mice behaviors based on their neural data. Specifically, using datasets from 13 mice, our analysis connects
variations in neural cell calcium flow to the behaviors observed in mice during the experiments designed by our client.
To achieve a more accurate prediction of mouse behaviors based solely on their neural data, we employed machine learning
models such as PCA integrated with logistic regression and random forests. Notably, our multi-layer perceptron model stood
out, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97%.


## Setup
This project is developed using R and R Studio. Refer to `mice_project-report.RMD` for the required packages.


## File Descriptions
- Data_Loading.R: An R script dedicated to importing and consolidating the neural data of mice into a singular container.
- Data_Wrangling.R: An R script designed for cleaning and refining the mice neural data.
- mice_project-report.RMD: An RMD file that produces the detailed analysis report for the project.
- mice_project-report.pdf: A PDF version of the project report, derived from the aforementioned RMD file.
