# Predictive Modeling of Mice Behavior through Neural Activity: Integrating PCA, Random Forest, and Multi-layer Perceptron Approaches

## Summary
In this project, I began by generating synthetic data that follows a multimodal Gaussian distribution with specified parameters. I then constructed various machine learning models to approximate this multimodal Gaussian distribution, subsequently comparing their accuracies and execution times.


## Setup
This project is developed using Python 3. Refer to `main.ipynb` for the required packages.


## File Descriptions
- `Data_Loading.R`: R script responsible for reading the mice neural data and organizing them into one container.
- `Data_Wrangling.R`: R script to clean the mice neural data.
- `mice_project-report.RMD`: RMD file generating the project analysis report.
- `mice_project-report.pdf`: The project PDF report generated by the RMD file.



## Content
This project includes 7 parts in total, specifically: 
1. Synthesize a multimodal Gaussian distribution
2. Fit a piecewise linear regression model
3. Fit three spline models with 2, 3, and 4 knots respectively
4. Compare the R-squared values and root mean square deviations (RMSD) of the models from the previous sections
5. Fit four polynomial models with degree 2,3,4,5 respectively
6. Compare the fitting times of the constructed models
7. Construct two polynomial models of degree 5 using Lasso and Ridge regularization techniques
